## Data Release

All data are presented in `json` file, with one PIP each line.

20K PIPs are sampled for each category, and then deduplicated by removing PIPs that have the same text but different from each other only in the suffix url automatically generated by Twitter. After that each PIP is checked and labeled manually. Drug, data-leakage, gambling, crowdturfing and surrogacy is ready. Weapon, harassment, porn, money-laundry and fake-document is still under labeling.
